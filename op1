Chinese and Indian soldiers are engaged in a major stand-off in Ladakh after Chinese troops yesterday stopped work on the construction of an irrigation canal being built under the rural development or MNREGA scheme, sources told NDTV.The incident took place yesterday in the Demchok sector, located 250 km east of Leh, where a project is underway to link a village with a hot spring.Yesterday, around 55 Chinese soldiers arrived at the scene along the Line of Actual Control or de facto border and halted the work in an aggressive manner, news agency Press Trust of India quoted unnamed officials as saying."[There are] routine objections and clarifications which either party seek whenever there is construction related activity.The issue is being resolved through established mechanisms," said army sources to NDTV, asking not to be named.72 strategic roads are being built along the border to narrow the gap with China's vastly superior and intricate network of roads and tracks in the mountains.C-130 Hercules planes bought from the United States have been landing at the airfield.Incursions from both sides are common along the Line of Actual Control, because the armies cannot agree where it lies.Around 1,000 soldiers from each side were ranged against each other for days toil the confrontation subsided.
