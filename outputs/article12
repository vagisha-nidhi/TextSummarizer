OK, let’s take him”.As I released my clenched hands, my mobile phone and notebook fell to the tiled floor.Then came the sharp sting of the plastic cable tie as it was sealed, pinching tight at the corners of my wrists.Two days earlier, I’d been sent to Ferguson, Missouri, by the Washington Post, to cover the aftermath of the police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old.The fatal gunshots, fired by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, on 9 August 2014, were followed by bursts of anger, in the form of protests and riots.For the Ferguson press corps – which would eventually swell from dozens of reporters for local St Louis outlets into hundreds of journalists from farther afield, including dozens of foreign countries – the McDonald’s on West Florissant Avenue became the newsroom.Others wanted officials to explain what had happened that day, to tell them who this officer was and why this young man was dead.At any point a resident or a group of them could begin a heated argument with the police or a reporter.It wasn’t much later that the riot-gear-clad officers entered the McDonald’s, suggesting we all leave because, with protests still simmering outside, things could get dangerous once the sun went down.Then, when it became clear that we were happy to wait and see how things developed outside, they changed their tune.When I didn’t move fast enough, they grabbed me.I was led out of the restaurant to wait for transport to police headquarters, with Ryan Reilly of the Huffington Post, who had also been arrested.The officer who arrested us had told us, smirking, that we’d be spending the night in the cells, but he was wrong.They locked us in a cell, but about half an hour later, we were turned loose.By the time we were given back our belongings – unlaced shoes, notebooks, phones – we’d become momentary media celebrities.But it became clear that I wasn’t escaping Ferguson any time soon.Resident after resident had told stories of being profiled, of feeling harassed.What was clear, from the first day, was that residents of Ferguson, and all who had travelled there to join them, had no trust in, and virtually no relationship with, the police.The police, in turn, seemed to exhibit next to no humanity towards the residents they were charged with protecting.The social justice movement spawned from Mike Brown’s blood would force city after city to grapple with its own fraught histories of race and policing.As protests propelled by tweets and hashtags spread under the banner of Black Lives Matter and with mobile phone and body camera video shining new light on the way police interact with minority communities, America was forced to consider that not everyone marching in the streets could be wrong.Ferguson would mark the arrival on the national stage of a new generation of black political activists – young leaders whose parents and grandparents had been born as recently as the 1970s and 1980s, an era many considered to be post-civil rights.Their parents’ parents had been largely focused on winning the opportunity to participate in the political process and gaining access to the protections promised them as citizens.For at least two decades, the days of taking the struggle to the streets had seemed, to many politically active black Americans, a thing of the past.Within minutes of the shooting, word spread through the surrounding apartments, and beyond, that Brown’s hands were up in the air when he was shot.They did know that the police in Ferguson looked nothing like them: an almost all-white force charged with serving and protecting a majority black city.Mike Brown’s body remained on the hot August ground – a gruesome, dehumanising spectacle that further traumatised the residents of Canfield Drive and would later be cited by local police officials as among their major mistakes.
