At the very beginning of his book, "The Nehru Dynasty", astrologer K.N.Rao mentions the names of Jawaharlal's father and grandfather.Why?No one tells us that!Now, who is this Feroze?We are told by many that he was the son of the family grocer.The grocer supplied wines,etc.But then we all know that everyone has two grandfathers, the paternal and the maternal grandfathers.In fact, the paternal grandfather is deemed to be the more important grandfather in most societies.Why is it then, no where, we find Rajiv Gandhi's paternal grandfather's name?It appears that the reason is simply this.This is the source where from the myth of Rajiv being a Parsi was derived.The fact of the matter is that (and this fact can be found in many writings) Indira was very lonely.It was just a case of a change of name by an affidavit.Why?When they returned to India, amock 'Vedic marriage' was instituted for public consumption.An inter-religious and inter-caste marriage under Vedic rites at that time was not valid in law.To be legal, it had to be a civil marriage".The death of Feroze in 1960 before he could consolidate his own political forces, is itself a mystery.Feroze had even planned to remarry.Here, in passing, we might mention that the second son was originally named Sanjiv.It rhymed with Rajiv, the elder brother's name.He offered to issue another passport to the felon who changed his name to Sanjay.!Sanjay was notorious in getting unwed young women pregnant.And that did the trick.Apparently he had wanted to get him married with a Muslim girl of his choice.Was he black mailing her with the secret of who his real father was?Nehru was no less a player in producing bastards.People, including MPs, thronged to her to hear her discourses.As she departed, I noticed (Mathai is speaking here) that she was young, shapely and beautiful.Meetings of Nehru with her became rather frequent, mostly after he finished his work at night...�  Suddenly Shraddha Mata disappeared.He said that a young woman from northern India arrived at the convent a few months ago and gave birth to a baby boy.She refused to divulge her name or give any particulars about herself.She left the convent as soon as she was well enough to move out but left the child behind.She however forgot to take with her a small cloth bundle in which, among other things, several letters in Hindi were found.The Mother Superior, who was a foreigner, had the letters examined and was told they were from the Prime Minister.The person who brought the letters surrendered them..".I (Mathai) made discreet inquiries repeatedly about the boy but failed to get a clue about his hereabouts.Convents in such matters are extremely tightlipped and secretive.Had I succeeded in locating the boy, I would have adopted him.He must have grown up as a Catholic Christian blissfully ignorant of who his father was".What is amazing is the extent of our people's ignorance in such matters.It is the western press that waged a blitz of misinformation on behalf of Rajiv.No doubt US kids are among the most misinformed in the world today!The reality is that in all three years of his tenure at that University Rajiv had not passed a single exam.He had therefore to leave Cambridge without a certificate.Sonia too had the same benevolent treatment.She was stated to be a student in Cambridge.Such a description is calculated to mislead Indians.e.in anyway on her own rights, then all Indians should be proud of her just as how proud we are of Mother Teresa.OR  Saying that any other party which comes to rule India is better is again equally worse.The point is Indians who nominate the people to stand in these elections; and the people who vote their rulers (i.e.the authorities) must know that truth eventually come out some day.- See more at: http://www.whereincity.com/articles/factual/cause-of-origin-of-pseudo-secularism-in-modern-india-6848.htm#sthash.cKZgXRBP.
