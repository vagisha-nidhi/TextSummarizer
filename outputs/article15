The reasons why accurate referencing is essential for academic work are not immediately apparent, particularly for students new to higher education.Secondly, references link the writer’s work to the existing body of knowledge.Becker (1986) believes the construction of arguments is the most important function of referencing systems.There are four dimensions to this.Third, referencing helps academic writers identify sources, gather evidence, as well as show the relationships between existing knowledge.Finally, referencing also provide a framework to enable writers to structure their arguments effectively by assessing, comparing, contrasting or evaluating different sources.For example, Barrow and Mosley (2005) combined the fields Human Resources and Brand Management to develop the ‘Employer Brand’ concept.When the argument has been constructed, it needs academic support – and only references can provide this required support.Referencing also enables writers to communicate their arguments efficiently.The referencing framework allows them to produce a holistic work with different perspectives, whilst still emphasising their own positions; quotations, for example, help the reader to differentiate the writer’s opinions from others.Neville (2007, p.10) emphasises this issue of writing style, and identifies the quest to “find your own voice” as one of the main reasons for referencing.This short quote brilliantly captures the point that the primary mission of science and other disciplines is not to promote individual achievements, but to establish a connected, collective, and recognised body of knowledge.This is the most fundamental reason for referencing from a theoretical point of view..] is that it encourages and supports the collective construction of academic knowledge” (Walker & Taylor, 2006, pp.Without these links an academic work would operate within an academic vacuum, unrelated to existing academic knowledge.A writer needs to show how his or her work relates to current research and debates in their chosen subject area.Neville also identifies the link to existing knowledge as one of the main reasons for adopting a referencing style; he highlights “tracing the origin of ideas”, “spreading knowledge” and “indicating appreciation” (2007, pp.9-10), which leads to the next point.However, this practice is not without its critics.Thody, for example, calls this the “sycophantic” use of referencing - and it can certainly be used to “flatter your mentors” (2006, p.27).So the important issue here is not about selecting references for their expediency value, but for their enduring quality.” Correct referencing enables, therefore, the reader to check sources and verify conclusions.The issue of credibility is identified by commentators as a key issue in referencing..] your credibility as an author” (2008, p.Neville came to the same conclusion that “to be taken seriously, [a writer] needs to make a transparent presentation of valid evidence” (2007, p.10).Also the Academic Learning Support from Central Queensland University (2007) sees the credibility of arguments as primary motive for correct referencing.Some readers, for example, interested in a point in question, might want to verify the writer’s interpretation of a referenced work.The quality of references is, therefore, extremely important for the credibility of an academic work.Only a credible work that takes all important arguments into account will find acceptance in the academic world.So what is the point of referencing?Thirdly, only referencing can give the argument credibility – and this is a particularly significant element for success in the academic world.
