A spongy new super-material could be lighter than the flimsiest plastic yet 10 times stronger than steel.The new super-material is made up of flecks of graphene squished and fused together into a vast, cobwebby network.The fluffy structure, which looks a bit like a psychedelic sea creature, is almost completely hollow; its density is just 5 percent that of ordinary graphene, the researchers said.What's more, though the researchers used graphene, the seemingly magical properties of the material do not totally depend on the atoms used: The secret ingredient is the way those atoms are aligned, the scientists said.Ultralight 'Super-Material' Is 10 Times Stronger Than Steel A new material is incredibly light yet stronger than steel.The new material gets its amazing strength from its unique geometric configuration.Credit: Melanie Gonick/MIT A spongy new super-material could be lighter than the flimsiest plastic yet 10 times stronger than steel.The new super-material is made up of flecks of graphene squished and fused together into a vast, cobwebby network.The fluffy structure, which looks a bit like a psychedelic sea creature, is almost completely hollow; its density is just 5 percent that of ordinary graphene, the researchers said.What's more, though the researchers used graphene, the seemingly magical properties of the material do not totally depend on the atoms used: The secret ingredient is the way those atoms are aligned, the scientists said.Advertisement  "You can replace the material itself with anything," Markus J. Buehler, a materials scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) said in a statement.The strongest material the researchers created was about as dense as the lightest plastic bag, yet stronger than steel.One obstacle to creating these superstrong materials is the lack of industrial manufacturing capability for producing them, the researchers said.However, there are ways the material could be produced at larger scales, the scientists said  For instance, the actual particles could be used as templates that are coated with graphene through chemical vapor deposition; the underlying template could then be eaten or peeled away using chemicals or physical techniques, leaving the graphene gyroid behind, the researchers said.In the future, massive bridges could be made of gyroid concrete, which would be ultrastrong, lightweight, and insulated against heat and cold because of all the myriad air pockets in the material, the researchers said.
