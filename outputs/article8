In the mid-1970s, India was so worried about its explosive population growth that policemen and officials travelled to villages to sterilise men, who hid in sugar cane fields or climbed trees to avoid vasectomies.Nearly three decades on, a new, non-coercive policy -- emphasising education of women and health care rather than demographic control -- has thrown up surprising results.7 percent now, fuelling hopes of stable growth by the middle of the century in a country with the world's second largest population at 1.1 billion people.Since half of India's population is younger than 25, it gives the country a potential edge over China, where an ageing population -- the result of a one-child policy could slow its economy by 2030, they said.A DELICATE ISSUE India is hoping by the time this dividend phase ends, around 2045, it will have achieved a stable and balanced population.There is a catch however.Education will play an important role.Population control has long been a delicate issue in India where politicians are wary of promoting family planning too vigorously, mindful of the lessons of history.In a country blighted by decades of poverty and illiteracy, many people, especially in rural India, still see an extra child as an extra pair of hands."People with large families are usually the ones who are outside the formal economy," said Nanda.However, this concept has strained city resources as migrants from the countryside crowd in, looking for work.Some experts worry the still rising population could rein in economic growth of around eight percent a year.5 million people each year.Efforts to forge a coherent policy have also been hampered by graft and a lack of knowledge."There is some progress in terms of control, but there are regional demographic imbalances wherein the population growth of one region has been negated by a fall elsewhere".Experts say the demographic imbalances could fan regional tensions as people move from the poorer heavily populated areas to richer southern India.Imbalances could also fan political tensions.More than 80 percent of secular India's people are Hindus, around 13 percent Muslims and the rest Christians, Sikhs and other minorities."But the challenge is to put effective birth control measures in the northern states".htm#sthash.
