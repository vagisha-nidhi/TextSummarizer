Part of a graveyard dating back around 3,400 years has been unearthed in southern Egypt at the site of Gebel el Silsila, Egypt's antiquities ministry has announced.Previously, the Lund University researchers had uncovered part of the cemetery during their 2015-2016 field season, and their more recent work in the 2016-2017 field season has revealed more of it, according to a statement from the ministry.An analysis of the skeletons found in the cemetery revealed that, in their lifetimes, the people buried there performed jobs that involved a heavy amount of manual labor and high risk of accidents."Fractures of the long bones and increased muscle attachments amongst the skeletal remains indicate behaviors related to occupational hazards and an extremely labor-intensive environment," Nilsson said.However, although they performed hard labor, those individuals also appear to have had access to decent food and medical care.The researchers also found evidence of the food the people would have consumed and some of the resources accessible to them."Fossils of sheep and goats, as well as a couple of Nile perch and almost complete crocodile, were found along with sandstone sarcophagi, sculptured and occasionally painted pottery coffins, painted cartonnage [a material used in creating mummy masks and some types of coffins], textile and organic wrapping, ceramic vessels and plates, as well as an array of jewelry, amulets and scarabs [artifacts shaped like a scarab beetle that sometimes contain writing]," Nilsson said.
