With the presidency of Donald Trump looming, what's the state of the field of economics, anyway?In The New York Times, Justin Wolfers painted a gloomier portrait of that same professional unity, held together by foreboding of the incoming Trump administration.First off, there's the question of whether widespread harmony in an intellectual field is a good sign or a bad one."When economists agree, sometimes we should be suspicious".Second, there's the question of how real the harmony even is.He pointed to massive and unresolved differences over macroeconomics and methodology, and more specific questions like the minimum wage, immigration, and more.In other words, many economists focus on assessments of various small-ball projects and social programs, creating the veneer of agreement, rather than engaging with big value-laden questions of how society should be ordered or which costs are truly justified."Economists don't talk about the stuff they agree with each other on," Bartlett said, because the disagreements are more dramatic and interesting.One major divide Bartlett did highlight, though, is between economists in academia and the ones who work in the private sector, often for big financial firms."Academics tend to look down on [business economists] as not being as rigorous in their analysis".In fact, if you read Wolfers' piece carefully, when he says economists are anxious about their lack of influence over the Trump administration, what he clearly means are academic economists.As Bartlett saw it, "extreme points of view are not necessarily rejected [among business economists] because they sometimes give you insights even if they end up being wrong".All professions have internal groups that compete to be the experts who reporters and policymakers turn to, and thus to speak for the group as a whole.Nonetheless it was Mishel who was most ferocious in his criticism of their blind spots.(In this case, many of those Americans were the white workers without college degrees who supported Trump.So they told a fairy tale of free trade to voters and politicians.They ignored the disappearance of unions, the minimum wage, and full employment as more plausible explanations that better fit the data.Veuger didn't share Mishel's critique on the inequality front.Veuger added the profession never really critically analyzed the eurozone, despite the disaster it has become, and that economists made a tacit decision to never say anything negative about immigration as well.Whether this is a crisis for the profession or not is another matter.The others took a longer historical view, seeing shifts in fads and changes of the guard as inevitable cycles in any field, with corrections and reforms needed from time to time."There's a sense of entitlement that I think goes a little far sometimes," Veuger observed.The business economists come with their own attendant vices, and even Veuger didn't sound super enthused about Trump's economic picks.So give it a few years, and sure as the sun will rise, the economics profession will be in for another course correction.
