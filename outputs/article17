TBeyond Antananarivo—Madagascar’s capital city—signs of urbanization give way to sprawling farms and sweeping grasslands.At the coastal city of Toliara to the south, after a full day’s journey, the road turns into tire-sucking sandy track that mainly serves cattle-drawn wooden carts.Finally, the Bay of Assassins appears, an oasis thrumming with life, fringed with lush evergreen mangroves.At low tide, the trees loom from exposed mud, balancing on woody, tangled roots like ballerinas en pointe; at high tide, cool seawater erases the dry world, transforming the scene into an underwater spectacle.Tiny metallic fry shimmer past, while adults lurk in the shadows.Hermit crabs shuffle along thicker, oyster-encrusted roots that loop down through the water.“People go into the mangroves every day,” says Viviany, a young woman wearing a T-shirt, sarong, and golden hoop earrings, her face smeared in a crumbling clay paste to block the sun.People bustle around her, many of them using the mangroves.People use nets to sift for shrimp in the saltwater creeks that trickle through the forest, and then pile their catch in the sun to dry.Older women gather hermit crabs at low tide from the sand farther into the mangroves, methodically smashing the shells against a stone anvil, pinching off the head and claws.Like the rest of the bay’s 3,000-odd residents, Vatoavo’s villagers are poor and very isolated.When they take mangrove trees, they usually take small and medium ones, leaving the largest.These mangroves have so far avoided the fate of other, more accessible, mangroves in the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where development of valuable coastal real estate—from aquaculture to big hotel developments to palm oil plantations—has destroyed the trees.Despite the bay’s minimal infrastructure—electricity, healthcare, and education are scarce—villagers are looking to improve their lives, through projects such as carefully managed octopus fisheries, and seaweed and sea cucumber farms.However, as in so many coastal communities, this increasing prosperity is changing the delicate relationship between people and mangroves.People are using more of the biggest, oldest mangrove trees to turn seashells into house-reinforcing—and increasingly affordable—lime clay.He looks about 60 and wears a felt fedora with a ribbon band, ripped shorts, and a sweatshirt.They are cut from the larger, older trees in the surrounding forest.When the single-use kiln is ready, the whole lot is set alight—wood and shells together—and left to burn until all that’s left is a pile of ashes and the coveted white lime.They use the oldest trees because large logs keep the fire going without refueling.“One kiln will make 35 or 40 sacks of lime,” the man says.Rendering a whole house takes at least 70 sacks.The man plans to use this batch to repair his house, which he says he built when his eldest son was knee-high; now his son has children of his own.“Lime production is not traditional at all,” says Lalao Aigrette, who works with an NGO called Blue Ventures.Aigrette says villagers have been cooking lime for fewer than 20 years, and its popularity has waxed and waned.Exactly how much demand has gone up remains unclear, but Aigrette sees reason enough to be worried.A clear-cut area several hundred meters wide, the size of an average city block, has no living mangrove trees, no green canopy, and no seedlings; just sun-drenched mud dotted with silvery stumps.These physical changes could stop seedlings from taking hold and prevent the forest from regenerating.She recalls that this swath was cut two years ago to supply a big local lime order.Aigrette recalls a priest from Andalambezo, a village about three kilometers south of the bay, who ordered tonnes of lime to build a school.“He said, ‘This is for your children,’” Aigrette says.Sacrificing trees now for education that may help secure the forests’ future may seem like a contradiction.Around the city of Ambanja, 1,000 kilometers north of the bay, the practice of charcoal making offers a cautionary tale for the bay’s villagers.People prefer mangrove charcoal for their cook fires, partly because it burns hotter and produces less smoke—the same reasons it makes a great limekiln.It’s part of a larger pattern; people have destroyed at least a quarter of mangrove forests around the world in the past 35 years, a rate of loss three to five times higher than deforestation on land.The loss of mangroves around the world, has, paradoxically, given the villagers several advantages: foresight and growing scientific knowledge of mangroves’ value.Aigrette and Blue Ventures are working with some of the bay’s residents on a so-called “blue carbon” initiative, whereby villagers would receive payments from the international carbon market in return for protecting and replanting mangroves in the bay.For now, mangroves continue to provide for the inhabitants of the Bay of Assassins and life goes on.A few moments later, a boy jumps down into the shallow water below, gathers an armful of branches, and begins the short walk back home to light a fire and feed his family.
