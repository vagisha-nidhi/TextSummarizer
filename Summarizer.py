The encounter was in progress, sources added.Significantly, the infiltration attempt from across the LoC in Sawjian sector of Poonch district came nearly 24 hours after half a dozen heavily armed terrorists attacked a BSF naka along the international border in Kathua district with small arms fire and rocket propelled grenades so as to cross over to the Indian side. The infiltration attempt was foiled by alert BSF personnel who retaliated killing one of them as during illumation of the area with the help of tracer bomb, terrorists fleeing back to Pakistan side were seen carrying a body with them, sources added.Meanwhile, a BSF jawan was injured as Pakistani Rangers continued resorting to mortar shelling and small arms fire on two forward Indian positions at Bobiyan in Hiranagar sector of Kathua district. Sources said that the fire from across the international border first came around 9.35 am and it continued for nearly 40 minutes.Thereafter, the Pakistani Rangers again resumed firing on Indian side around 12.15 noon, sources said, adding that it was continuing till reports last came in. The Indian side was also retaliating.Ever since, India carried out surgical strikes across the Line of Control causing sufficient damage to terrorists and those shielding them last month, Pakistan has been resorting to mortar shelling and small arms fire at one or the other place along the borders in Jammu region. It continued lobbing mortar shells, besides resorting to automatics and small arms fire along the LoC in Rajouri district’s Manjakote area of Bhimber Gali sector throughout Wednesday night.The Indian troops retaliated appropriately. There had been no casualty or damage on the Indian side. Pakistani troops have resorted to firing in Rajouri sector also this afternoon."

#text = "Mahatma Gandhi is well known as the “Father of the Nation or Bapu” because of his greatest contributions towards the independence of our country. He was the one who believed in the non-violence and unity of the people and brought spirituality in the Indian politics. He worked hard for the removal of the untouchability in the Indian society, upliftment of the backward classes in India, raised voice to develop villages for social development, inspired Indian people to use swadeshi goods and other social issues. He brought common people in front to participate in the national movement and inspired them to fight for their true freedom.He was one of the persons who converted people’s dream of independence into truth a day through his noble ideals and supreme sacrifices. He is still remembered between us for his great works and major virtues such as non-violence, truth, love and fraternity. He was not born as great but he made himself great through his hard struggles and works. He was highly influenced by the life of the King Harischandra from the play titled as Raja Harischandra. After his schooling, he completed his law degree from England and began his career as a lawyer. He faced many difficulties in his life but continued walking as a great leader.He started many mass movements like Non-cooperation movement in 1920, civil disobedience movement in 1930 and finally the Quit India Movement in 1942 all through the way of independence of India. After lots of struggles and works, independence of India was granted finally by the British Government. He was a very simple person who worked to remove the colour barrier and caste barrier. He also worked hard for removing the untouchability in the Indian society and named untouchables as “Harijan” means the people of God.He was a great social reformer and Indian freedom fighter who died a day after completing his aim of life. He inspired Indian people for the manual labour and said that arrange all the resource ownself for living a simple life and becoming self-dependent. He started weaving cotton clothes through the use of Charakha in order to avoid the use of videshi goods and promote the use of Swadeshi goods among Indians. He was a strong supporter of the agriculture and motivated people to do agriculture works. He was a spiritual man who brought spirituality to the Indian politics. He died in 1948 on 30th of January and his body was cremated at Raj Ghat, New Delhi. 30th of January is celebrated every year as the Martyr Day in India in order to pay homage to him."
#text = "Discipline is something which keeps everyone under good control. It motivates a person to go ahead in the life and get success. Each one of us has experienced discipline in different forms according to their own requirement and understanding towards life. It availability of it in everyone’s life is very necessary to go on the right path. Without discipline life becomes inactive and useless as nothing go according to the plan. If we need to implement our strategy in right way about any project to be completed, we need to be in discipline first. Discipline is generally of two types. One is induced discipline in which we learn to be in discipline by others and another one is self-discipline which comes from own mind to be in discipline. However sometimes, we need motivation from someone effective personality to improve our self-discipline habit.We need discipline in many ways at many stages of our life so it is good to practice discipline from the childhood. Self-discipline means differently to different people such as for students, it means motivating ownself to get concentrated on the study and complete assignments in right time. However, for working person, it means to get up from bed on time in the morning, do exercise to get fit, go to office on time, and do job tasks properly. Self-discipline is highly required by everyone to have, as in modern time no one has time for others to motivate towards being in discipline. Without discipline one can be failure in the life, she/he cannot enjoy academic success or other success in the career. Self-discipline is required in every field like dieting (it needs to control over fatty and junk foods), regular exercise (it needs to concentrate), etc. One can get health disorders and fatty body without control over food so it needs discipline. Parents need to develop self-discipline habits as they need to teach their kids a good discipline. They need to motivate them all time to behave well and do everything at right time. Some naughty children do not follow their parent’s discipline, in such cases parents need to have dare and patience to teach their naughty children. Everyone has different time and capacity to learn the meaning of discipline according to the nature. So, never give up and always try to get in discipline, as a small step can be converted to large step a day."
